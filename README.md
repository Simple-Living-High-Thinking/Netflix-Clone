# Netflix-Clone
 This repository contains a clone of the popular streaming platform Netflix, built using HTML and CSS. 
 The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across different devices and screen sizes.
 The clone accurately replicates the visual elements and layout of the official Netflix website, including the landing page, movie/TV show listings, and user interface 
 components. While the functionality is limited to the front-end, the project serves as an excellent example of implementing responsive web design principles and coding with 
 HTML and CSS.
